#### Description

Glumo is meant to be a tool of support for people who suffer from diabetes, providing a monitoring service for the glycemic levels. With its functionalities, based upon a direct connection with the sensor, and bypassing the need of a further glucometer, it replaces traditional methods such as lancing devices and reactive stripes.
<br>
<br>
Our solution consists of an app that provides a user-friendly representation of glucose readings, by asynchronously polling the sensor via Bluetooth connection. Moreover, the app offers functionalities such as acoustic alarms for notifying the trespassing of glycemic thresholds, emergency SMS messages in case of not acknowledged danger values, graphical representation of the history, export and import of data, bolus calculus and check upon carbohydrates levels in food.
